##FAQs

### Which language should I learn first?
You can start with any one of the above languages(C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Python). Learn the basic syntax, some basic data structures like an array and linked list, and make some small programs like Fibonacci series, factorial etc.
Just start somewhere, don't just keep looking for the best language. Learning a second language will not be difficult.



### I haven't studied computer science in my 11th and 12th. Do I have any disadvantage?
Think of it as a marathon, it's not a sprint. Initially, of course, you have a disadvantage but in the long run, you can defeat others by your consistency. Just start somewhere and work hard.
